# My First Android Studios App
## Advanced Java with Android Studios
#### 09/27/2024
The assignment asked for an application with 4 TextViews, 4 ImageViews, 2 Buttons, 2 Screens, one Android Toast, and one LogCat output. The theme is Valley View High School, which is why the color palette is red, white, and black. I decided to base the app on revealing the "Top 3 Animals" as images through the user clicking buttons.
